The **Tiny Scarab** is an open source hardware project launched by <a href="https://embeetle.com/" target="_blank"><img width="24" src="https://github.com/Embeetle/tiny-scarab/assets/19362684/e0cdd4a1-5d5b-47df-a8c9-bfc94e6a3e78" style="float:left"> Embeetle</a>, in collaboration with <a href="https://devheads.io/" target="_blank"><img width="24" src="https://github.com/Embeetle/tiny-scarab/assets/19362684/80b0f2b4-92b5-459e-b805-48252bfecde0" style="float:left"> DevHeads</a>. It's the first in the series of Beetle Boards. Expect more to show up in the months ahead!

The Beetle Boards will get special attention in Embeetle IDE. The're the perfect candidates to discover the capabilities of this IDE. Being open source, they're also a great option for your next hardware project.

## 1. Overview

The **Tiny Scarab** is a microcontroller development board based on the 10-cent RISC-V `CH32V003F4P6` MCU from WCH:
