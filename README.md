# Tiny Scarab

The Tiny Scarab is an open-source development board built around the popular 10 cent `CH32V003F4P6` RISC-V microcontroller from WCH. Using this dev board is uncomplicated: just plug it into your computer with a USB-C cable, and you're ready to code - the flasher/debugger is already embedded in the board for your convenience. Now you might wonder - why yet another dev board? Aren't there thousands already?

Well - this dev board is presented to you with a new coding IDE. Not satisfied with the current offering of IDEs for microcontrollers, we created a brand new one from scratch: <a href="https://embeetle.com/" target="_blank"><img width="24" src="https://github.com/Embeetle/tiny-scarab/assets/19362684/e0cdd4a1-5d5b-47df-a8c9-bfc94e6a3e78" style="float:left"> Embeetle IDE</a>. With the Tiny Scarab and Embeetle IDE, you'll discover how smooth programming a microcontroller can be.
